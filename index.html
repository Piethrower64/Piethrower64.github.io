		President Roosevelt participated in the dedication of the new 76-acre "Moana Park" in 1934 (it was later renamed
		Ala Moana Park in 1947.)

		In 1958, a 20-page booklet was sent to Congress to encourage them to turn back Ala Moana Reef to the Territory
		of Hawaiʻi for the construction of a "Magic Island."

		It was supposed to be part of a new high scale beachfront resort complex with a half-dozen hotels that would
		have included two islands built on the fringing reef, offshore of the Ala Moana Park.

		There is good reason to fear Ala Moana Park may be wiped out entirely so far as the people of Oahu are concerned
		if they don't keep alert and guard" against every effort to encroach upon it. (Honolulu Record, May 15, 1958)

		in 1964 a 30-acre peninsula, with “inner” and “outer” beaches for protected swimming, was constructed adjoining
		the Ala Wai Small Boat Harbor and Ala Wai Canal outlet.

		The project stopped after the development of “Magic Island,” leaving the State with a man-made peninsula, which
		they converted into a public park.


		In 1972 the State officially renamed Magic Island to ‘Āina Moana (“land [from the] sea”) to recognize that the
		park is made from dredged coral fill. The peninsula was turned over the city in a land exchange and is formally
		known as the ‘Āina Moana Section of Ala Moana Beach Park, but many local residents still call it Magic Island.
